<p><h2>When did i realized that i wanted to do something technology related?</h2>
When i was a kid there was a computer in my house (the OS was Windows 98, so if you are familiar with this operative system you should know how old it is), and it always made me very curious that i could spend hours and hours trough the files, all the folders and every inch of this amazing world that i was slowly getting introduced.
